        <h1 class="refCap">This assignment is the type that you don't know where to start but once you do, everything moves quite smoothly. Except that's what I thought it would be. Having some basic HTML knowledge from my secondary school studies. Turns out most parts of this weren't things I know before.</h1>

        <h1 class="refCap">Typography systems are something that I had no idea about until attending this class. After learning them I realise how often they are around us, from magazines to public signs to art pieces that have text on them, these systems appear one way or another. This is my first time using Creative Cloud, so at first, I was kind of confused by Illustrator, but after an hour or two I started to get used to it (just remember to hold shit when resizing so they scale without looking weird) Looking back, I think the grid and modular systems could look more different from each other, without the modular could look like a grid.</h1>

        <h1 class="refCap">The CARP task is the one I look most forward to, as I did some "posters" for school events back when I was still in secondary (I used Canva so it doesn't really actually count) I got the idea for the first poster basically the moment we learned about the task. The last two actually came to my mind last minute but to be honest, I prefer them more than the first. I do still love the idea of the first one, but I wish the execution could be better. InDesign is in my opinion the hardest program to use throughout the entire assignment, the limited functions made me use other software (Photoshop, Illustrator, Procreate etc.) and then import them into InDesign. It still works, but I would've learned more about the different functions of InDesign next time so I could rely less on other software.</h1>

        <h1 class="refCap">For the HTML worksheets, given my previous experience, the first two worksheets are quite easy for me, but the easy part then stops there. I never learned anything about flexbox and CSS (all my styles are written onto the HTML file directly before) It took me some time to understand how flexing works and how the CSS is linked with the HTML file, but other parts are straightforward and I can understand them after one or two tries. As I expected, this is the part that went the most smoothly.</h1>

        <h1 class="refCap">Putting everything together is another challenge. The one that took me the most time to figure out was the homepage. I need footage of me making all the different elements, even setting a camera on top of a bookshelf so I could shoot a top-down shot of me writing the HTML code. Because it is a video background. At first, for some reason, all my content are behind the video, it took me two days and some help to finally get them back to the top. Other than this and some careless mistakes (not closing a tag, typo, fixed width or height etc.) everything went smoother than I thought.</h1>

        <h1 class="refCap">After the combined hard work of almost 1.5 months, I can't say I'm not proud of it. Yes, there are things that I wish I could do better, but it is my work after all. I Look forward to the next semester.</h1>
