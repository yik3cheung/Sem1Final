        <h2>The following three works use the CARP design principles (contrast, repetition, alignment and proximity) we learned in week 3 to redesign the poster for the Bristol International Balloon Fiesta. With one extra poster as an improved version of one of the original three.</h2>

            <img class="postImg" src="images/poster_rd1.png" alt="Redesign 1">
            <p class="postCap">Inspired by the grid of a hot air balloon, this poster uses the grid to place images related to the event. The colourful gradient texts and logos contrast with the dark background, creating a striking image that catches viewers' attention.</p>
        </div>
            <div class="postGroup">
            <img class="postImg" src="images/poster_rd2.png" alt="Redesign 2">
            <p class="postCap">Inspired by old prints, this poster uses text as the background with a hot air balloon in front. The bottom includes all the information and sponsors, increasing readability. The palette, font and filters of this poster resemble an old newspaper or print that has been yellowed because of age.</p>
        </div>
            <div class="postGroup">
            <img class="postImg" src="images/poster_rd3.png" alt="Redesign 3">
            <p class="postCap">With a simplistic and futuristic look, this poster creates the shape of a hot air balloon as the explorer's shadow, inviting the viewers to join the event and explore what Europe's largest ballooning event has to offer. The simple black, white and silver palette and the metallic look give the event a modern look. All texts are aligned with the grid and lines along the left and bottom, making them coherent.</p>

            <img class="finPostImg" src="images/poster_rd4.png" alt="Final design">
        <div class="post-mediacontent">Improved upon the second redesign, this final redesigned poster increased the hot air balloon's outer border's thickness and improved the grid of the balloon. A halo glow was also added around the balloon. Increasing the contrast for better visibility and letting the balloon be the first thing viewer sees.</div>
